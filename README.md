# Lab 1 Code 

Included inside of this repo is a folder of paperbot and simulation.  The paperbot folder is where the code for the robot which uses an Arduino nano lives.  The simulation is where the code (from google collab python) where the simluation results and robot results for the test driving case were graphed. 

## Paper Bot 

This is based on the skeleton coded provided for by the professor. It includes capability to connect to the robot over wifi and control from a computer or phone.  It also includes additional functions from the original code for sensor capability.  These include the sensors for front and right distance to nearest obstacle which gives the translation of the robot across the field.  This also includes the IMU which gives magnetic field values and heading which gives the rotational velocity of the robot.  T

## Simulation 

Simulation results were graphed and coded from google collab in python.  If there are any errors to viewing the file, please download and view inside of the google collab environment.
